# Arqiva-core
This is the core of the next generation documentation generation tool.
Arqiva allows you to turn markdown into HTML in the most awesome way.

# Motivation to build Arqiva
Arqiva's primary goal is to help us easily produce great documentation for Hi-Framework. We are currently using Daux.io which is not proving
 itself to be flexible and awesome enough.
 
 
# How is Arqiva different from Daux.io
* Its Java based
* Its highly extensible: Arqiva has an architecture inspired by Maven in terms of modularity and allows teams to build personalized documentation
without having to look for another documentation tool. Teams can choose or build their own template engine, they can even pick their preferred markdown
parser with the flavours they love. Arqiva provides hooks to let third-party java code transform the generated HTML in the different phases it observes.
* Its built to work with an awesome built tool: Maven. Adding a new module means nothing but adding a new maven dependency
